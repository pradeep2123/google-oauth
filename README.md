# google-oauth using node 
Hi, from it i had did it normal signup or google oauth where user values can be stored in mongodb once signup or by oauth signup. for normal signup, email has sent for verification and if verified by user, account gets activated for signin. For, oauth signin/signup verifications not neccessary.  once signin, dashboard will be called. 

In there, freshdessk widgets will be there, once click the authorize button. it checks the api key either correct or not. if its created it creates ticket.
